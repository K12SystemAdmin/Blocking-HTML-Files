### To every skid that is looking at this repository, please note that if you are trying to bypass your schools web filters and they block it, do not be mad or upset that they block it and I will tell you why schools do it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The **_CIPA_** or the **_Children's Internet Protection Act_** requires schools to implement monitoring software to your school computers that may be _**Federally, District, or School**_ funded because of this law, this may include stuff like

+ `Access by minors to inappropriate matter on the Internet;`
+ `The safety and security of minors when using electronic mail, chat rooms and other forms of direct electronic communications;`
+ `Unauthorized access, including so-called “hacking,” and other unlawful activities by minors online;`
+ `Unauthorized disclosure, use, and dissemination of personal information regarding minors; and`
+ `Measures restricting minors' access to materials harmful to them.`

_**And when you are trying to bypass these restrictions, you may or may not be breaking the US State Law when avoiding these restrictions**_

_That is why you may be losing your internet privileges when your IT Admin/Manager & School Administrator find out that you are avoiding these restrictions_
