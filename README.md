# Blocking-EaglerCraft-HTML-Files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings District IT Admins/Managers & especially you "Skiddies", I am a former Skidder who would bypass the school filters/restrictions because I would hate the filters that would block even the most simplest sites there would be, and now, I am a Student Tech worker that is currently helping my schools IT Manager into blocking/patching these bypasses, So now I decided to give out my knowledge as a student to you IT Admins's
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So here are the steps to do so, and is really simple as well :-) (_**Keep in mind that this needs to be done in GAC (Google Admin Console)**_

### **Step 1.** _(Step Uno)_

Go to the Google Admin Cosole > Devices > Chrome > Settings User & Browser Settings/Management _(It may be different for some of you)_

### **Step 2.** _(Step Dos)_

Go to the JavaScript section and go to where is says `Block Javascript On These Sites` or something closely related to it


### **Step 3.** _(Step Tres)_

Put this as the as the block - **_file:///*_**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Although you may be asking... `"What does blocking JavaScript do?"`

Well, it blocks from JavaScript Files from running off the Local Files from your chromebook or from any computer, so when a HTML file like eaglercraft gets loaded up from the Local Files or from USB, it immediately gets frozen and stops it from loading
